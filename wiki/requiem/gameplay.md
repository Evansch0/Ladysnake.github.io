# Gameplay Mechanics
## First Death

Upon dying for the first time in a world, a dialogue will be prompted to the player. In this menu, the
player can select whether or not he wants to become a demon, and activate the mod for himself or not.
After choosing, the player obtains the "A Devilish Conundrum" and the dialogue will not be prompted anymore.
However, the player can still change their mind by using an [Opus Daemonium](opus_daemonium) at a later time.

### Origins Compatibility
With the [Origins](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins) mod installed, the choice is made through its selection screen when first joining the world.

## Soul State

If the player is a demon and dies, their demon souls splits from the host's and escapes the destroyed body. <br />
In this state, the player can easily fly and navigate the world in search of a new host to possess. The player is granted creative 
fly and can use the sprint key to navigate in the air (similarly to how a player would swim ) and go through one block tall holes. <br />
To possess a new body and leave the soul state, the player must find an undead mob with an inventory and interact with them
(a crimson eye should render upon placing the cursor on an entity). The list of the valid undead Vanilla Minecraft mobs is as follows:

- Skeleton
- Stray
- Wither Skeleton
- Zombie
- Husk
- Zombie Villager
- Zombie Pigman
- Drowned

## Body Transformation after Death

In some cases, the player's body might transform after death, giving birth to an undead creature. In those few situations,
the player's soul is not expelled from the dying body, and keeps full control of it.

The list of events that lead to a body transformation after death is as follows:

- Dying from a Zombie or a Drowned will turn the player into a Zombie
- Dying in lava while being in the Nether will turn the player into a Wither Skeleton
- Dying from suffocation by sand will turn the player into a Husk
- As Vanilla game behaviour guarantees, staying too long underwater as a Zombie will turn the player into a Drowned

## Undead Gameplay

After finding a new host or transforming after death, the player is forced to play as an undead creature. Undead players behave
very similarly to undead mobs, meaning they both have their strengths and weaknesses. For instance, a Stray player will shoot
slowness arrows, but will also burn if exposed to sunlight.

Undead players:

- Are generally slower than human players
- Do not have hunger, but can sprint nonetheless
- Do not suffocate underwater
- Cannot swim (unless possessing a Drowned).
- Do not naturally regenerate health. Please read the "Special item uses for Undead" section for information on how to heal in other ways.
- Are ignored by hostile mobs, unless the player attacks them, but will be targeted by golems.
- Do not receive any experience from combat, but will still be able to obtain some from other sources (such as mining, fishing and breeding animals).
- Do not have the strength to swing their sword in a manner to do area damage.
- Receive damage from instant health potion and health from instant damage potions.

## Special Item Uses for Undead

Depending on the undead possessed, the player is able to use items differently from how he would if he was human.


### Raw meat ("Zombie Snack")

Raw meat can be eaten by Zombie players (all sub-types included) to regenerate health. 
A piece of meat regenerates as much health as it would recover food for a human player.

### Raw fish ("Drowned Delicacy")

Raw fish can eaten by Drowned exclusively, and serves the same purpose raw meat does.


### Bones ("Bony Prosthesis")

Skeletons (all sub-types included) can replace their damaged bones by new ones. To do so, just use a bone and it will regenerate 4 health points (2 hearts).

### Milk buckets ("Calcium Goodness")

Skeletons (all sub-types included) can drink milk for extra bone resistance. Drinking a milk bucket grants the player Resistance for 30 seconds.

### Bows ("Skeletal Efficiency")
Using a bow as a Skeleton (all sub-types included) has a chance to not consume an arrow when shooting. Resulting arrows are not recoverable.

### Tridents ("Drowned Grip")
Throwing a trident as a Drowned has a chance to keep it in hand and duplicate it. Resulting tridents are not recoverable.

## Becoming Human Again

To recover their humanity and get rid of their rotting body, an undead player has to go through the purification
progress every Zombie Villager must. By getting the Weakness effect, undead players are able to eat Golden Apples.
Doing so results in the player turning back into human form.
