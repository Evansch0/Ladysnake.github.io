## What is Requiem?

Requiem is a Minecraft (Java Edition) mod aiming at removing the continuity break resulting from death. <br />
In vanilla Minecraft, dying is bland and can be frustrating: you lose all your items and get redirected
to a menu where you can choose to reappear at your spawn point or quit the game.<br />
With Requiem installed however, this immersion-breaking menu is removed and dying gives place to various gameplay elements.

## Why would you want to use it?

As explained above, Requiem is great for players willing to make death a little different from most games.
Additionally, Requiem has other benefits and features that other players can enjoy:

 - Explorers wanting to venture far in their world, only to be retained by their death leading back to their respawn point. 
   As such, Requiem allows an infinite journey, so you don't have to walk the same path twice.
 - Players searching to change their playstyle by roleplaying an undead, fleeing sunlight, drowning endlessly
   in the ocean or eventually searching for preys to feast on.
 - And players wanting to experience this new Death, while having friends not willing to. 
   The mod allows both death systems,Vanilla and Requiem, to coexist in the same world at the same time, 
   depending on each player's needs.

## Mod Interactions
