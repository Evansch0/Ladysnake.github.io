<h1>{% include svg/cca-banner.svg %}</h1>

A components API for Quilt and Fabric that is easy, modular, and extremely fast.

If you are a regular minecraft player, you may need this API to play with your favorite mods.
Just download the version that works for you - Cardinal Components API does not have any user-facing feature by itself.

If you are a developer, detailed information is available in the [**developer wiki**](landing).
The information below is a condensed form of the latter.

## Features\*
- 🔗 Attach data to a variety of vanilla classes
- 🧩 Implement once, plug anywhere - modded data will be saved automatically
- 📤 Synchronize data with a single helper interface
- 👥 Choose how components are copied when a player respawns
- ⏲️ Tick components alongside their target
- 🛠️ Fine-tune everything so that it fits your needs
- ☄️ And enjoy the blazing speed of ASM-generated extensions

*\*Non exhaustive, refer to the wiki and javadoc for the full list.*
