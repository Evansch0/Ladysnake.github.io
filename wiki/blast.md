## BLAST is a Fabric mod about bombs.
That's it, just bombs. But why? Because:

- Blowing stuff up is probably one of the most entertaining things in Minecraft.
- TNT is way too expensive, and gets boring quickly.
- Mining with explosives takes less time, is more enjoyable, and allows you to roleplay a dwarf demolitionist.

## Bomb types

Currently, BLAST introduces 4 bombs, all currently for mining purposes. These bombs need to be crafted with 
"Boompowder",&nbsp;<img src="blast/boompowder.png" alt="boompowder" class="p-wiki-icon" />&nbsp;obtained by combining gunpowder, coal (not charcoal) and sugar.  
All bombs can be found in the tools section of the creative inventory and be thrown using dispensers.
