		<p>Most living entities can be possessed. Notable exceptions are the Enderdragon, the Wither boss, and otherplayers.</p>
		<h3 id="passive-behaviours">Passive behaviours</h3>
		<p>
		Every entity behaviour that does not depend on its AI works by default during possession. Some changes have
		been made to vanilla behaviours to better integrate into gameplay. Notable possessed passive behaviours
		include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Skeletons have quasi-infinity:</strong> each time they shoot from a bow, they have around 80%
				chance to not consume an arrow</li>
			<li><strong>Witches can brew potions on the fly:</strong> when they are holding a water bottle, witches will
				automatically brew the potion they need to survive certain situations.</li>
			<li><strong>Undead horses can be mounted by any undead</strong></li>
		</ul>
