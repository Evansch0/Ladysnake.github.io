      description: >
        Before doing anything else, please read attentively this "read me".
        It contains most of the information you'll need for your stay, including rules,
        channel and role description. Please note that if you do not read this
        and ask a question that is answered here, you'll be redirected to this page
        and asked to read it.

- type: rules
  rules:
    General Housekeeping: >
      - Follow Discord's [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and
        [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).
        They will be enforced as rules, even if the indiviual clauses aren't spelled out here.
        - By extention, follow the spirit of our rules, rather than the actual words.

      - Don't be the reason these rules have to be edited or explained further, as noted above.

      - Please communicate in legible english, as other languages are hard to moderate.

      - Please keep every channel's intended purpose in mind, and read the channel descriptions if you're unsure.
        - If you have any questions or concerns, please **contact an Admin or Moderator - they always have the final say**.

    Be Civil: >
      - Insults, slurs, and hate towards any individual or group are not tolerated.
        - Your profile must not have an offensive profile picture, or an offensive name or nickname. 
      
      - Constant antagonistic behaviour is considered uncivil and therefore not accepted. Sarcasm is not a toxicity permit.
      
      - Swearing is tolerated, but do not abuse it.
      
      - Keep your posts PG-13. Please also avoid controversial subjects, unless there is a specific moderator-designated channel for it.

    Be Considerate: >
      - **Before posting in a channel for the first time, read the channel topic.**
        -  Channel topics often contain important information about the channel and extra rules that must be followed as if they were part of the server-wide rules. 
        - Disrespecting channel-specific rules are equivalent to breaking server-wide rules.
      
      - Using the bots in a way to do prohibited stuff for normal users is naturally prohibited.
      
      - Please do not spam, flood, or excessively ping people. Particularly important users or roles may cause automatic moderation actions to be taken against you, unless prior whitelisting has been granted.
        - Check if a reply ends up pinging by accident - those count as pings too.
      
      - Consider the other users around you, and don't annoy them. Moderators hold to right to judge this accordingly.

    Have Etiquette: >
      - Promotion, advertising and Discord server invitations are forbidden, unless you are given a specific authorization by one of the moderators. Exceptions apply.
      
      - Talking in another channel to circumvent a lockdown will earn you a timeout, and may result in that channel being locked down for everyone.
      
      - Hoisting (using special characters to make your nickname appear at the top of the user list) is forbidden.
      
      - Repost "memes" (ex. "Post this to another server", "Repost this to get a free cookie", etc.) are not welcome here.
      
      - Do not act as or impersonate another user or nick yourself in a way that is confusing or misleading.
      
      - Spreading misinformation will not be tolerated. You must have an up-to-date, reliable source for any information you share. Using an invalid source or using justification like "so-and-so told me" counts as spreading misinformation.

    Keep Note: >
      - Do not ping <@251798331536310273>, <@484072044787400736>, or other members of <@&924382019742474300> without prior permission. In some cases, automatic action may be taken against you.
      
      - Joining Content SMP is very rare and exclusive to only particular chosen people. 
        - Asking to join will not get you anywhere.

        - Not sure what a channel is for? Every channel has a topic, so please read it to make sure you're in the right place.
          Some channels are not designed for chatting, but for posting content. Discussions can be held in threads.

        - Before asking a question, checking pinned messages and searching the channel history is a good idea.

        - If you think someone is breaking the rules, don't hesitate to ping <@&926214810637586492>.
          - Please do not ping this role for requesting general answers, only for reporting rule-breaking behaviour or when you feel there is a problem.
        
        - For general questions, feel free to ask in <#924374894085566475> or <#924695867783536690>, Our users would be glad to help you.
