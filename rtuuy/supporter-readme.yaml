        Thank you for supporting Rat! You are now a supporter of Rat's content and are eligible for the following perks:

        - Access to the supporter Minecraft server

- type: rules
  rules:
    Da Rulez: >
      - All discord rules apply in the Minecraft server.

      - No major griefing without permission. Minor griefing is allowed for small pranks that can be easily fixed.
        No griefing of natural landscapes just for the sake of griefing.

      - No major stealing. Minor stealing may be tolerated for characters who are mischief-makers, but important items
        must not be stolen unless intentions are to return them.

      - No stealing major items for any reason if the owner is offline.

      - No hacking or cheating of any kind. No abusing glitches or mods that give an advantage. This includes (but is not
        limited to) minimaps, fullbright, x-ray, and auto-clickers. If in doubt, ask Rat.

      - No using end crystal, respawn anchor, or bed explosions for PvP purposes.

      - Recordings are allowed as long as everyone involved is okay with it.

      - No using eyes of ender. Eyes of ender in one's hands will be automatically removed.

      - **Failure to follow these rules will result in revocation of your server access, even if you remain a supporter.**

      - Maid outfit: not required, but highly encouraged.
    Airship Rules: >
      - There is one airship on the SMP. It is like the one from the [expedition video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfjs0MNpf8c).

      - It is free for all, and griefing rules are largely relaxed in the airship. If you take it from someone, you may change
        the interior as you wish.

      - You are free to do what you want with it: fight, negotiate, trade, etc. It is yours to win just as it is to lose.

      - Think of it as the hill in King of the Hill, or some territory in a faction server.
